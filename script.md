Call the FCC Script
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Jeff Lyon from CallTheFCC. In a moment, we'll connect you to an FCC
employee. If you'd like, we can call you back every day around this time so you
can keep calling other FCC employees and asking for their help. 

Being a daily caller is completely optional and you can stop at any
time. But with enough daily callers, our voices will be impossible to ignore.

To make a single call to the FCC right now, press star. To become a daily
caller, press one.

* Thanks! We'll call you back around this same time tomorrow. You can stop
  receiving these calls at any time by following the in-call menu or emailing
  support@callthefcc.com

Alright! We're connecting you to the FCC now. When they answer, say you're
calling because you're worried that Tom Wheeler will ignore our millions of
comments for Title 2 because of his history as a cable company lobbyist. Ask
them to do anything in their power to protect net neutrality using Title 2.
